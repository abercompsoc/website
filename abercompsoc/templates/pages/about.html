    <p>Welcome to the Webpage for the Aberystwyth Computer Science Society</p>

    <p>We are a group of students at Aberystwyth with a keen interest in all things
      Comp Sci. The society aims to provide an environment where like minded people
      can meet and discuss topics of interest. We also aim to attend various events
      and work on projects for fun.</p>

    <p>We usually meet once a month at the Brynamlwg Tavern on campus to discuss
      matters over a few pints.</p>

    <p>Interested in joining? Find our <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/abercompsoc">mailing
      list</a> or join us on
      <a href="https://abercompsoc.slack.com/signup">slack</a>.</p>
